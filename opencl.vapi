		/**
		 * Used to set the argument value for a specific argument of a kernel.
		 *
		 * A kernel object does not update the reference count for objects such as
		 * memory, sampler objects specified as argument values by clSetKernelArg.
		 * Users may not rely on a kernel object to retain objects specified as
		 * argument values to the kernel.
		 *
		 * Implementations shall not allow {@link Kernel} objects to hold reference
		 * counts to kernel arguments, because no mechanism is provided for the
		 * user to tell the kernel to release that ownership right. If the kernel
		 * holds ownership rights on kernel args, that would make it impossible for
		 * the user to tell with certainty when he may safely release user
		 * allocated resources associated with OpenCL objects such as the
		 * {@link Memory} backing store used with {@link Memory.Flags.USE_HOST_PTR}.
		 *
		 * An OpenCL API call is considered to be thread-safe if the internal state
		 * as managed by OpenCL remains consistent when called simultaneously by
		 * multiple host threads. OpenCL API calls that are thread-safe allow an
		 * application to call these functions in multiple host threads without
		 * having to implement mutual exclusion across these host threads i.e. they
		 * are also re-entrant-safe.
		 *
		 * All OpenCL API calls are thread-safe except clSetKernelArg, which is
		 * safe to call from any host thread, and is safe to call re-entrantly so
		 * long as concurrent calls operate on different kernel objects.
		 * However, the behavior of the kernel object is undefined if
		 * this method is called from multiple host threads on the same
		 * object at the same time.
		 *
		 * There is an inherent race condition in the design of OpenCL that occurs
		 * between setting a kernel argument and using the kernel with
		 * {@link CommandQueue.enqueue_range} or {@link CommandQueue.enqueue_task}.
		 * Another host thread might change the kernel arguments between when a
		 * host thread sets the kernel arguments and then enqueues the kernel,
		 * causing the wrong kernel arguments to be enqueued. Rather than attempt
		 * to share kernel objects among multiple host threads, applications are
		 * strongly encouraged to make additional kernel objects for kernel
		 * functions for each host thread.
		 *
		 * If the argument is a memory object (buffer or image), the arg_value
		 * entry will be a pointer to the appropriate buffer or image object. The
		 * memory object must be created with the context associated with the
		 * kernel object. A null value can also be specified if the argument is a
		 * buffer object in which case a null value will be used as the value for
		 * the argument declared as a pointer to _\_global or _\_constant memory in
		 * the kernel. If the argument is declared with the _\_local qualifier, the
		 * arg_value entry must be null. If the argument is of type sampler_t, the
		 * arg_value entry must be a pointer to the sampler object.
		 *
		 * If the argument is declared to be a pointer of a built-in or user
		 * defined type with the _\_global or _\_constant qualifier, the memory
		 * object specified as argument value must be a buffer object (or null). If
		 * the argument is declared with the _\_constant qualifier, the size in
		 * bytes of the memory object cannot exceed {@link DeviceInfo.MAX_CONSTANT_BUFFER_SIZE}
		 * and the number of arguments declared with the _\_constant qualifier
		 * cannot exceed {@link DeviceInfo.MAX_CONSTANT_ARGS}.
		 *
		 * For all other kernel arguments, the arg_value entry must be a pointer to
		 * the actual data to be used as argument value.
		 *
		 * @param index The argument index. Arguments to the kernel are referred by
		 * indices that go from 0 for the leftmost argument to n - 1, where n is
		 * the total number of arguments declared by a kernel.
		 *
		 * @param arg_value A pointer to data that should be used as the argument
		 * value for argument specified by arg_index. The argument data pointed to
		 * by arg_value is copied and the arg_value pointer can therefore be reused
		 * by the application after this method returns. The argument value
		 * specified is the value used by all API calls that enqueue kernel
		 * ({@link CommandQueue.enqueue_range} and {@link CommandQueue.enqueue_task})
		 * until the argument value is changed by a call to this method for kernel.
		 *
		 * @param arg_size Specifies the size of the argument value. If the
		 * argument is a memory object, the size is the size of the buffer or image
		 * object type. For arguments declared with the _\_local qualifier, the size
		 * specified will be the size in bytes of the buffer that must be allocated
		 * for the _\_local argument. If the argument is of type sampler_t, the
		 * arg_size value must be equal to sizeof(cl_sampler). For all other
		 * arguments, the size will be the size of argument type.
